# 3rd project at 42 - get_next_line (with BONUS)
For this project the main goal was to create a code that would be able to read from a file descriptor (fd) and keep track of every line that it read.
It was quite difficult to understand how the first approach would be but once I got the hang of it everything went smoothly.
Memory allocation had a big importance in this project and a lot of time was used to make sure I didn't have any leaks

The bonus part was to make sure that my code would be able to read from multiple file descriptors meaning that it would read the first line from the 1st file then the 1st line from the 2nd and so on.
The project was graded 125/100
